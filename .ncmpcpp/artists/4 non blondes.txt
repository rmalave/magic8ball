90s American alternative rock band. Lead vocalist Linda Perry has since released solo work and produced songs on hit albums by P!nk, Lisa Marie Presley and Christina Aguilera. The band consisted of bassist Christa Hillhouse, guitarist Roger Rocha, drummer Dawn Richardson and vocalist Linda Perry.   4 Non Blondes had a huge hit single in 1993 with "What's Up". A year later, DJ Miko remixed the track as a dance song, and it became a hit again, on radio and in clubs.
